# Drum Kit ü•Å

This is a fun and interactive project created to practice my **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** skills. The **Drum Kit** allows users to play different drum sounds by either clicking on buttons or pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard.

## Key Features:
- Play different drum sounds using keys: **w, a, s, d, j, k, l**.
- Interactive button animations when clicked or pressed.
- Simple, clean design with custom images for each drum button.
- Responsive and intuitive user experience.

## How It Works:
- Each button represents a drum sound, and the sounds are triggered using **JavaScript event listeners**.
- The sounds are played through the `Audio` object in JavaScript, and a visual animation is added when the keys or buttons are pressed.
